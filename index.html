            Agent 47 is the world's top assassin, a legendary figure in the shadowy trade of assassination.
        </p>
        <p>
            A victim of illegal experimentation at the sinister "<a href="https://hitman.fandom.com/wiki/Institute_for_Human_Betterment">Institute for Human Betterment</a>" in 1960s Romania, 47 is exceptionally intelligent with superior instincts and reflexes. A man comfortable in his own skin and in total control of his environment. An expert strategist, master of disguises and social chameleon who is always two steps ahead, he is a skilled predator: discrete, precise and endlessly inventive.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result of his tragic past, 47 is completely devoid of empathy, but is acutely aware of this and has "outsourced" his conscience to his long-time handler <a href="https://hitman.fandom.com/wiki/Diana_Burnwood">Diana Burnwood</a>. She curates 47's contracts, targeting only the most infamous criminals as well as the wealthy, who put themselves above the law.
        </p>
        <p>
            Together, 47 and Ms. Burnwood have developed a signature MO of disappearances, "Tragic accidents" and deaths of natural causes. Carried out with artistry, surgical precision and zero collateral damage. For this reason, 47 boasts a perfect <a href="https://hitman.fandom.com/wiki/International_Contract_Agency">ICA</a> record and remains, at the very most, an urban legend.
        </p>

            He is a ghost: Rarely noticed and never remembered...
